# RPC for CMUS

## Introduntion
first, the title explains everything and second,
you spelled intropunction wrong

## Client? what is this, a server?  
We need a server script that communicates with discord rpc
and a script to send info from cmus to the server. because
discord needs the script to run indefinitely but cmus runs
the script everytime it changes the status, so yeah.

### Which is which?
`rpc_server.py` is the server which it's the script that
sets the discord presence to the recieved data from client. \
`cmus-rpc.py` is the client which it sends the info to the
server. you can change this code to for example get from
mpv and sends it to the server.
